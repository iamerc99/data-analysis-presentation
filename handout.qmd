# Introduction

**FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)**  
FRED is maintained by the *Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis* @FRED2024 and provides thousands of U.S. and international time-series indicators, including GDP, inflation, employment, interest rates, and financial data. Its strengths include a clean interface, extensive metadata, and a reliable API for programmatic access.

**DB.nomics**  
DB.nomics is an open global data aggregator that combines macroeconomic and statistical datasets from a wide range of providers such as Eurostat, OECD, IMF, World Bank, and various national statistical offices @DBnomics2024. It aims to make economic data transparent, accessible, and comparable across countries and institutions.

**Overall Significance:**  
Economic data platforms support evidence-based decision-making in government, business, and research. They allow users to monitor economic performance, evaluate policy outcomes, analyze historical trends, and create reproducible workflows for academic or professional projects.



# Student Perspective

## Educational Value
Access to real-world economic data enhances students’ understanding of key economic theories such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment @Mankiw2021, and encourages development of *data literacy*, *quantitative reasoning*, and *critical analysis*, allowing students to connect theoretical knowledge with practical application.

## Research and Projects
The availability of reliable economic data enables students to perform *empirical research*. It also provides reliable data sources for coursework in *economics*, *finance*, *public policy*, and *data analytics*.  

## Skill Development
Working with real datasets offers students the opportunity to practice using analytical tools such as *Excel*, *R*, *Python*, and *Stata*.Through these experiences, they build *analytical*, *statistical*, and *data visualization* skills valued in both academia and the job market.  



# Comparison of FRED and DB.nomics

Both platforms offer economic indicators, but they differ in focus, structure, and best-use scenarios.

| Feature | FRED     | DB.nomics |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Main Focus    | U.S. economic and financial indicators + selected global data | Global, multi-provider datasets (Eurostat, OECD, IMF, national statistical offices) |
| Best Use      | U.S. macroeconomic trends, financial indicators, interest rates | International comparisons, cross-country research, multi-provider datasets |
| Features      | Clean charts, metadata, strong API, high reliability | Wide provider coverage, standardized downloads, flexible filters |
| Limitations   | Primarily U.S.-centered | Interface less polished; some datasets vary in formatting |

In practice, **FRED** is excellent for U.S. macro-financial data, while **DB.nomics** is ideal for global statistical analysis.



# How to Access Data

## Website Interface
Both platforms provide intuitive interfaces for exploring, visualizing, and downloading datasets.

### FRED
1. Go to [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org)
2. Use the search bar (e.g., type “U.S. Inflation Rate” or “GDP”).
3. Click on the desired series.
4. Explore the interactive chart.
5. Click **Download** → CSV, Excel, or JSON.

### DB.nomics

1. Go to [db.nomics.world](https://db.nomics.world)
2. Use the search box or browse by provider (e.g., Eurostat, OECD).
3. Choose the dataset and variables you need.
4. Use filters (e.g., time range, country, indicator).
5. Click **Download** → CSV, XLSX, or JSON.

Website interfaces are suitable for quick exploration, data previews, and simple visualizations.



# APIs (Automated Access for Analysis)
APIs offer programmatic access to datasets and are widely used in academic research because they ensure **reproducibility**, **automation**, and **consistency** @Peng2011.

### FRED API
The R package `fredr` lets you retrieve U.S. economic data, such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates. You need a free API key to use it.

### DB.nomics API
The R package `rdbnomics` provides access to global datasets from many providers (e.g., IMF, World Bank, Eurostat). No API key is required.



# How to Analyze Data (Spreadsheet)

## Step 1: Download Data
Example: U.S. GDP (Quarterly).  
Users can download CSV or Excel files directly from FRED or DB.nomics.

## Step 2: Open in Excel
- Open the downloaded file in Excel.
- You’ll usually see columns like Year and GDP.

## Step 3: Create a Simple Chart
Highlight the relevant columns and insert a line chart to visualize trends over time.

| Year | GDP (USD Trillions) | 
|------|---------------------|
| 2020 |        19.96        | 
| 2021 |        23.43        | 
| 2022 |        25.86        | 
| 2023 |        27.53        | 
| 2024 |        29.15        | 
| 2025 |        30.49        | 

**Table 1:** Example Dataset (simplified):



# Analyzing Data using R

R is a powerful tool for working with economic time-series data. It enables data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

You’ll mainly use two packages:

- fredr → to access FRED data via API
- ggplot2 → to visualize trends
